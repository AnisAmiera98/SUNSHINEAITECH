1. Project Manager ( Anis Amiera Binti Zamrin Hasbullah )

Project managers are responsible for planning, organizing, and directing the completion of specific projects for an organization while ensuring these projects are on time, on budget, and within scope. By overseeing complex projects from inception to completion, project managers have the potential to shape an organization’s trajectory, helping to reduce costs, maximize company efficiencies, and increase revenue.The exact duties of a project manager will depend on their company, organization, and the types of projects that a Project Manager is tasked with overseeing. But across the board, all project managers share responsibilities across what’s commonly referred to as the “project life cycle,” which consists of five phases (or processes).
Initiating,
Planning,
Executing,
Monitoring and Controlling,
Closing.

2. System Designer ( Norsaza Amalia Binti Mohd Saiful Abidin )

System Designer will assist in establishing the development of the project. They will assemble the suite of technical resources that requires, and identify any custom software that needs. System Designers take on a role similar to a computer hardware engineer, yet their role can also be strong on creativity and problem-solving duties. They may be required to track character progression from concept to implementation, defining crafting elements, skill trees and level tables. The responsibilities may include assembling all software and hardware required, Produce prototypes, oversee testing and implement changes and create customized software.


3. Programmer ( Fairuz Diana Binti Hamzah)

Generally responsible for the development, design and implementation of new or modified software products or ongoing business projects. A Computer Programmer, or Systems Programmer, writes code to help software applications operate more efficiently. Their duties include designing and updating software solutions, writing and updating source-code and managing various operating systems. A programmer also may specialize in one or more computing fields, like database, security or software/firmware/mobile/Web development. These individuals are instrumental to the development of computer technology and the field of computing.After completing a program design, a programmer converts the design into a series of codes or instructions that the computer can run and execute, making use of a specific programming language and required platforms.
